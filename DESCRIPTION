Description: A statistical hypothesis test for conditional independence.
    Given residuals from a sufficiently powerful regression, it tests whether 
    the covariance of the residuals is vanishing. It can be applied to both
    discretely-observed functional data and multivariate data. 
    Details of the method can be found in Anton Rask Lundborg, Rajen D. Shah and Jonas
    Peters (2020) <arXiv:2101.07108>.
