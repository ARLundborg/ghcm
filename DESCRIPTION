Description: OLD!: A statistical hypothesis test for conditional independence.
    It performs nonlinear regressions on the conditioning variable and then tests
    for a vanishing covariance between the resulting residuals. It can be applied
    to both univariate random variables and multivariate random vectors. Details
    of the method can be found in Rajen D. Shah and Jonas Peters (2018) <arXiv:1804.07203>.
